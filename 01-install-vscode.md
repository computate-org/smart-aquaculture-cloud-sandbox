## VSCode

Developing software is not easy without the right tools. 
Although I've worked for years with other IDEs like Eclipse, 
the new standard for software development of all kinds is VSCode.

## VSCode Plugins

Once you have VSCode installed and running, take a look at the Plugins on the left. 
VSCode makes it very easy to install very useful plugins. 
Here is a list of plugins we will be using to develop your new data-driven website and API. 
Install the following plugins which will be used for the rest of the course. 

- YAML: YAML Language Support by Red Hat, with built-in Kubernetes syntax support. 
- Jupyter: Jupyter notebook support, interactive programming and computing that supports Intellisense, debugging and more.
- Extension Pack for Java: Popular extensions for Java development that provides Java IntelliSense, debugging, testing, Maven/Gradle support, project management and more

And my favorite plugin if you love Vim: 
- Vim: Vim emulation for Visual Studio Code
