    "An open source search engine like Apache Solr is required by the Smart Village application API to serve up API stored objects as quickly as possible. APIs that are backed by a search engine have numerous additional benefits compared to an API backed by a traditional relational database. A search engine is always indexed for the fastest data retrieval possible. The advanced data and query parsing of a search engine allows for extremely fast full text search, filtering, and sorting of the data. Search engine data can also be grouped, faceted, and pivoted on, for an advanced set of analytics and statistics on specific data in your query. \n"
